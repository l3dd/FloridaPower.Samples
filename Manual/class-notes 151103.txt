WCF / ASMX - SOAP Services

- Unification of networking API's
- Support for SOAP and WS-* Soap specs
- SOA - Service oriented architecture
- Transport independence

Problems with WCF & SOAP:
- SOAP never really caught on
- SOAP not supported by all clients: browsers, mobile
- XML is verbose, performance issues
- WCF was over-architected: you have to be an expert to do it properly
- WCF is not a 'modern' platform: lack of support for dependency injection, testability

Bottom line: DO NOT USE WCF for greenfield app dev!

New Paradigm: REST-ful services using ASP.NET Web API
- Leveraging HTTP for application semantics
- More modern framework: better support for dependency injection
- Microsoft is investing heavily in the web stack

REST is a continuum
- lowest level: using POX or JSON
- resource-centric vs operation centric API
- HATEAS: hypermedia driving app state via embedded links in responses

Research:
- WWF and ASP.NET 5

Take away #1:
DO NOT USE the default Visual Studio templates for creating Web API services!!
- Uses SystemWeb.dll -> 20 MB footprint, increased per request overhead

Take away #2:
Also: DO NOT USE Web API Self Hosting
- Depends on WCF, which is deprecated

Take Away #3:
From now on, use OWIN for hosting Web API services!
- Completely ecoupled from the underlying host
- Self-hosting no dependency on WCF
- Web hosting can be decoupled from SystemWeb.dll (Project Helios)
- App model is used by ASP.NET 5 (vNext: RC in Nov, RTM in 2016 Q1)

Vishal: Owin Hosting options
- Owin Web Hosting: Use IIS as your host
  > Today: This DOES has a dependency on SystemWeb.dll
  > Tomorrow: It will NOT have a dependency on SystemWeb.dll (ASP.NET 5)
- Owin Self Hosting: Use Windows Service as your host
  > Need control over the lifetime of the process (for ex, cache control, etc)
- OwinHost Hosting: Use OwinHost.exe process for your host
  > Friendly to cloud-based deployments (for ex, using Docker containers)

Vishal: Serialization question
- Json serialization and size limits

TODO: Web API Security (3rd day if time permits)
- Add to course manual and samples
